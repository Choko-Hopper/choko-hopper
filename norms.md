What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide?
Have an outside (somebody who isn’t a disagreeing party) person mediate a conversation and help find a compromise. If it’s a tech issue, the whole group should be in on the meeting. If it’s a soft skills/approach issue, just a mediator is fine.
What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.
Person A (frustrated, THINKING TO ONESELF) **I’m concerned about XYZ. I’m going to take a short coffee break to think about potential solutions**
Person A: **Ask person B** How do you think we’re doing on XYZ? Where are we on this? Use this as a way for person B to explain if they’re confused or overwhelmed.
If Person B doesn’t have a reason or explanation…
Person A: You were saying yesterday that you hoped to have XYZ finished by this morning. Do you think you could have it done by [time]?
What does this group do when we merge our work together?
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?
Reviewer is responsible for the actual merge. He/she/phe should confirm the merge to whomever requested it.
When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?
After 10 minutes, ask other members for help. If we can’t get it after another 15 minutes by checking docs, Googling, or looking over old workshops, ask a fellow/instructor.
How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?
Pairs can decide on their own norms (while preserving group norms about Git). Anything about switching/timing is up to them.
How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?
It’s okay to work after hours even if the whole group isn’t present or if you aren’t pairing. There is no expectation/obligation to work after hours unless the group agrees on it beforehand. Just make sure that before we break for the day, you’ve made it clear to the group what you intend to do and how much.
What time does this group have daily stand up?
Daily stand up should happen at around 10:30am, or as soon as possible after whatever planned activity there is. There should be a group “check-in” at around 6pm where any after-hours work is discussed.
